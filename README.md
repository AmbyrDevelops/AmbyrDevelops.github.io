# AmbyrDevelops

Welcome! I’m Ambyr, a full stack web developer. Thanks for visiting my interactive resume that I use to share my skills, experience, and projects.

I re-designed my portfolio recently to try a scrollable parallax design. My goal was to make my page more concise and easier to scan on mobile while allowing the content to shine through.
